"""
Team Building (Forward/Midfielder + Defenders) Based on Greedy Algorithm and Player Social Network

This script constructs a team of football players using a greedy algorithm, leveraging 
a network representing player relationships and abilities. The algorithm aims to create 
a balanced team with strong individual skills and good synergy between players.

Key Concepts:

* Player Graph: A network where nodes represent players and edges represent similarity 
   between players (based on club, nationality, etc.).
* Greedy Algorithm: An iterative approach where the best available player is added 
   to the team at each step, considering both individual quality and fit within 
   the existing team.
* Player Abilities: Various skills (e.g., passing, shooting, defending) that 
   contribute to a player's overall value.
* Team Balance: Ensuring a mix of player positions (e.g., defenders, midfielders, 
   forwards) to form a complete team.
